            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Education is the transmission of knowledge, skills, and character
                traits. There are many types of education. Formal education happens in a complex institutional
                framework, like public schools. Non-formal education is also structured but takes place outside the
                formal schooling system. Informal education is unstructured learning through daily experiences. Formal
                and non-formal education are divided into levels. They include early childhood education, primary
                education, secondary education, and tertiary education. Other classifications focus on the teaching
                method, like teacher-centered and student-centered education. Forms of education can also be
                distinguished by subject, like science education, language education, and physical education. The term
                "education" can also refer to the mental states and qualities of educated people and the academic field
                studying educational phenomena.<br><br>The precise definition of education is disputed and there are
                disagreements about what the aims of education are and to what extent education is different from
                indoctrination by fostering critical thinking. These disagreements affect how to identify, measure, and
                improve forms of education. Fundamentally, education socializes children into society by teaching
                cultural values and norms. It equips them with the skills needed to become productive members of
                society. This way, it stimulates economic growth and raises awareness of local and global problems.
                Organized institutions affect many aspects of education. For example, governments set education policies
                to determine when school classes happen, what is taught, and who can or must attend. International
                organizations, like UNESCO, have been influential in promoting primary education for all
                children.<br><br>The main field investigating education is called education studies. It examines what
                education is, what aims and effects it has, and how to improve it. Education studies has many subfields,
                like philosophy, psychology, sociology, and economics of education. It also discusses comparative
                education, pedagogy, and the history of education. In prehistory, education happened informally through
                oral communication and imitation. With the rise of ancient civilizations, writing was invented, and the
                amount of knowledge grew. This caused a shift from informal to formal education. Initially, formal
                education was mainly available to elites and religious groups. The invention of the printing press in
                the 15th century made books more widely available. This increased general literacy. Beginning in the
                18th and 19th centuries, public education became more important. It led to the worldwide process of
                making primary education available to all, free of charge, and compulsory up to a certain age.</p>

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Education in India is primarily managed by the state-run public
                education system, which falls under the command of the government at three levels: central, state and
                local. Under various articles of the Indian Constitution and the Right of Children to Free and
                Compulsory Education Act, 2009, free and compulsory education is provided as a fundamental right to
                children aged 6 to 14. The approximate ratio of the total number of public schools to private schools in
                India is 10:3.<br><br>Education in India covers different levels and types of learning, such as early
                childhood education, primary education, secondary education, higher education, and vocational education.
                It varies significantly according to different factors, such as location (urban or rural), gender,
                caste, religion, language, and disability.<br><br>Education in India faces many challenges and
                opportunities, such as improving access and quality, reducing disparities and dropouts, increasing
                enrolment and completion rates, enhancing learning outcomes and employability, strengthening governance
                and accountability, promoting innovation and technology, and addressing the impact of COVID-19 pandemic.
                It is influenced by various policies and programmes at the national and state levels, such as the
                National Education Policy 2020, the Samagra Shiksha Abhiyan, the Rashtriya Madhyamik Shiksha Abhiyan,
                the Midday Meal Scheme, the Beti Bachao Beti Padhao Scheme, and the National Digital Education
                Architecture. It is also supported by various stakeholders and partners, such as UNICEF, UNESCO, World
                Bank, civil society organizations, academic institutions, private sector entities, and media outlets.

            <p class="sectionTag text-big">Let's Grow Together</p>
            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Educate Together is an educational charity in Ireland which is the
                patron body to "equality-based, co-educational, child centred, and democratically run" schools.It was
                founded in 1984 to act as the patron body for the new multidenominational schools that opened after the
                establishment of the Dalkey School Project. As of 2019, Educate Together is the patron of 90 national
                schools in Ireland. In 2014 three Educate Together Second Level Schools opened in Dublin 15, Drogheda
                and Lucan along with the first Educate Together school outside Ireland, in Bristol in the United
                Kingdom. In joint patronage with Kildare and Wicklow ETB, Educate Together opened another second-level
                school, Celbridge Community School, in 2015.<br><br>Educate Together has its roots in the Dalkey School
                Project founded in the 1970s.[1][8] Before multi-denominational education, some of those involved in
                education in Ireland, such as √Åine Hyland, Michael Johnston and Florrie Armstrong, questioned the
                denominational nature of the system and the need to have students of different faiths in different
                schools.<br><br>The number of schools run by the organisation has grown: in 2007 it was 40, in 2008 it
                was 44 and by 2018 this number had risen to over 100 including its second-level schools and its schools
                in the UK. In terms of pupil numbers, 2018 was the first year in which there were over 25,000 students
                attending an Educate Together school. By 2009 Educate Together had become the fastest-growing patron of
                schools in Ireland.In 2015, three new schools opened in Tuam, County Galway, Pelletstown, Dublin and New
                Ross, County Wexford and one in Kildare.</p>
